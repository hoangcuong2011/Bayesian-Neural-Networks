ZhuSuan
=======


|build| |docs| |license| |gitter|

**ZhuSuan** is a python probabilistic programming library for Bayesian deep
learning, which conjoins the complimentary advantages of Bayesian methods and
deep learning. ZhuSuan is built upon
`Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_. Unlike existing deep
learning libraries, which are mainly designed for deterministic neural
networks and supervised tasks, ZhuSuan provides deep learning style primitives
and algorithms for building probabilistic models and applying Bayesian
inference. The supported inference algorithms include:

* **Variational inference** with programmable variational posteriors, various
  objectives and advanced gradient estimators (SGVB, REINFORCE, VIMCO, etc.).

* **Importance sampling** for learning and evaluating models, with programmable
  proposals.

* **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** (HMC) with parallel chains, and optional
  automatic parameter tuning.

Installation
------------

ZhuSuan is still under development. Before the first stable release (1.0),
please clone the repository and run
::

    pip install .

in the main directory. This will install ZhuSuan and its dependencies
automatically. ZhuSuan also requires Tensorflow version 1.0 or later. Because
users should choose whether to install the cpu or gpu version of Tensorflow,
we do not include it in the dependencies. See
`Installing Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/>`_.

If you are developing ZhuSuan, you may want to install in an
"editable" or "develop" mode. Please refer to the Contribution section below.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available online:
`zhusuan.readthedocs.io <http://zhusuan.readthedocs.io>`_

Examples
--------

We provide examples on traditional hierarchical Bayesian models and recent
deep generative models.

To run the provided examples, you may need extra dependencies to be installed.
This can be done by::

    pip install ".[examples]"

* Gaussian:
  `HMC <examples/toy_examples/gaussian.py>`_
* Toy 2D Intractable Posterior:
  `SGVB <examples/toy_examples/toy2d_intractable.py>`_
* Bayesian Neural Networks:
  `SGVB <examples/bayesian_neural_nets/bayesian_nn.py>`_
* Variational Autoencoder (VAE):
  `SGVB <examples/variational_autoencoders/vae.py>`_,
  `IWAE <examples/variational_autoencoders/iwae.py>`_
* Convolutional VAE:
  `SGVB <examples/variational_autoencoders/vae_conv.py>`_
* Semi-supervised VAE (Kingma, 2014):
  `SGVB <examples/semi_supervised_vae/vae_ssl.py>`_,
  `RWS <examples/semi_supervised_vae/vae_ssl_rws.py>`_
* Deep Sigmoid Belief Networks
  `RWS <examples/sigmoid_belief_nets/sbn_rws.py>`_,
  `VIMCO <examples/sigmoid_belief_nets/sbn_vimco.py>`_
* Logistic Normal Topic Model:

Contribution
------------

To install ZhuSuan in an "editable" or "develop" mode, run
::

    pip install -e .

in the main directory. This installation is removable by::

    python setup.py develop --uninstall

Additional dependencies for developments can be installed by::

    pip install ".[dev]"

Tests
^^^^^

This command will run automatic tests in the main directory::

    python -m unittest discover -v

Test Coverage
"""""""""""""

After running tests, to ensure test coverage over the
developments, run::

    coverage report --include="zhusuan/*"

PEP8 Code Style Check
"""""""""""""""""""""

We follow PEP8 python code style. To check, in the main directory, run::

    pep8 .

Docs
^^^^

Docs are written under ``docs/`` directory as RestructuredText (``.rst``)
files. ``index.rst`` is the main page. A Tutorial on RestructuredText can be
found `here <https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html>`_.

API References are automatically generated by
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_. They are under ``doc/api/``
directory and should be regenerated each time when any code changes::

    make api

To compile docs into webpages, Run
::

    make html

under ``docs/`` directory. The generated webpages are in ``docs/_build`` and
can be viewed with browsers.
